        <p>Java is a high-level, versatile, and object-oriented programming language.<br></p> It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995. Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This characteristic is achieved through the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle.</p>
        
        Key features of Java. include:<br></b>
        
        <p><b>Object-Oriented:</b><br></p> Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, allowing developers to model real-world entities using objects.</br></p>
        
        <p><b>Platform Independence:</b><br></p> Java applications can run on any device with a compatible JVM, whether it's a computer, mobile phone, or embedded system.
        
        <p><b></b>Security:</b><br></p> Java has built-in security features to protect systems from harmful activities, making it a popular choice for developing applications on the internet.
        
        <p><b>Portability:</b><br></p> Java code can be easily moved from one system to another without modification, as long as a JVM is available for the target platform.</br></p>
        
        <p><b>Multithreading:</b><br></p> Java supports concurrent programming through its built-in multithreading features, enabling the execution of multiple threads simultaneously.
        
        <p><b>Rich Standard Library:</b><br></p> Java provides a robust standard library that includes packages and classes for various functionalities, simplifying development and reducing the need for external libraries.
        
        <p><b>Automatic Memory Management:</b><br></p> Java uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory, freeing developers from manually handling memory allocation and deallocation.
        
        Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile applications (Android is built using Java), enterprise-level applications, and more. It has maintained its popularity due to its versatility, reliability, and large community support.</p>
